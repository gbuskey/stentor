The call signature of `newsfile.WriteFragments`
was changed to take a bool `keepHeader`.
This breaking change is required
to fix the duplication of the newsfile header.

API Changes:
- `newsfile.WriteFragments` now takes a new boolean argument,
  indicating whether to keep the existing newsfile header or not.

Behavior changes:
- `stentor` no longer provides a default header template.
  Instead,
  the existing newsfile header will be preserved,
  unless configured with a `header_template`.
